An attempt to recreate a simplified version of  UUParsing-lib's parser implementation 

I am trying to understand the implementation by extracting the minimum code to run an applicative
Future parser.   I am hoping to use this to improve my haskell coding.   There is no new code
of mine in this project, it is just taking code from the UUParsing-lib and simplifying the 
implementation to bare minimum.
